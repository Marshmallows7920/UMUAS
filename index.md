			<h2>Introduction</h2>
		</header>
		<p>We are a student group dedicated to the development of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. We design aircraft that can perform tasks, such as aerial reconnaissance, payload delivery, area surveillance, and more.
		<br><br> We compete in national and international competitions that test the capabilities of our aircraft in different scenarios.</p>

					<h3>Our Team</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Our student group was founded in the summer of 2018 by a group of engineering students eager to try something new and to make a name for the University of Manitoba in the field of aerospace and unmanned drones. 

<br><br>With our passion for creativity, design and exploring the boundaries of technological capabilities we are not afraid of pushing ourselves to design and compete with new and exciting technologies like drones. </p>

					<h3>Our Drones</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Every year we make improvement to our UVA to match the competition criteria. So this year we will design some specific parts and put them on the UVA from last year.   The main frame is made of carbon fiber with six branches and six separated motors mounted on each end. This configuration gives us a high maneuverability to travel in all directions, meanwhile it also reduces the risk of mission failure caused by the breakdown of motors. In order to make our UVA safer and more user-friendly, we add a crumple zone on all branches which can absorb all the mechanical energy generated by unexpected strikes, such as accidentally knocking on a wall, or dropping onto the ground, and etc. The parts in the crumple zone are easy to replace. Lastly, the size and the pitch of the UVA can be adjusted.</p>

			<h2>Sponsorship</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Sponsorships help us acquire high quality materials and components for our drones. They allow us to rapidly prototype new ideas and innovate. Better sensors and subsystems give us a competitive advantage over other teams in competitions we participate in.</p>
